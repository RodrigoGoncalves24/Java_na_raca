**** SOME BASIC OPERATIONS ****

- For this directory, a copy of the set structure was implemented

OPERATIONS:
1° - "add(x)" -> Adds an element without duplication - CHECK
2° - "remove(x)" -> Removes an element and updates the structure accordingly  - CHECK
3° - "contains(x)" -> Returns true if an element is present in the set - CHECK
4° - "size()" ->  Returns the size of the set - CHECK
5° - "isEmpty()" -> Returns true if the set is empty - CHECK
6° - "clear()" -> Remove all elements from the set - CHECK

Learning goals:
After building this program, it was possible to practice programming logic and deepen the understanding of data structures.
Understanding the methods and how they work is a fundamental part of the learning process.

AI-assisted development:
- Showing how the method was implemented
- Fixing logic issues and explaining the algorithm flow
