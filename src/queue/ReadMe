**** SOME BASIC OPERATIONS ****

- For this directory, a copy of the map structure was implemented

OPERATIONS (FIFO):
1° - "enqueue(x)" -> Adds an element - OK
2° - "dequeue()" -> Removes and returns the element from the beginning - OK
3° - "peek()" -> Returns the first element without removing ti - OK
4° - "size()" -> Return the size of the queue - OK
5° - "isEmpty()" -> Returns true if it's empty - OK
6° - "clear()" -> Clear the structure - OK
7° - "print()" -> Print the elements of the structure - OK

Learning goals:
Through the implementation of a queue data structure, it was possible to practice the core FIFO (First In, First Out) concept.
This involved removing the first element and reallocating the remaining elements to preserve
the queue’s behavior, while also exercising programming logic.

AI-assisted development:
AI was used to explain the main queue methods
