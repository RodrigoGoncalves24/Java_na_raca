**** SOME BASIC OPERATIONS ****

- For this directory, a copy of the arrayList structure was implemented

OPERATIONS:
1° - "add(x)" -> Adds an element and double its size when full - CHECK
2° - "remove(x)" -> Removes an element - CHECK
3° - "get(x)" -> Returns the element at a given index - CHECK
4° - "size()" -> Returns the size of the array - CHECK

Extra:
5° "sort()" -> Order by bubble sort - CHECK

Learning goals:
After building this algorithm, it was possible to practice programming logic and
gain a deeper understanding of the internal methods of an ArrayList.
Understanding its methods and how they work is highly important for both personal and professional development.

AI-assisted development:
- Listing the methods to be implemented (without code generation)
- Clarifying questions about the sorting algorithm construction, along with explanations
