**** SOME BASIC OPERATIONS ****

- For this directory, a copy of the linkedList structure was implemented

OPERATIONS:
1° "addFirst(x)" -> Inserts an element at the beginning of the list. - CHECK
2° "addLast(x)" -> Inserts an element at the end of the list. - CHECK
3° "removeFirst()" -> Removes and returns the element that is removed. - CHECK
4° "removeLast()" -> Removes and returns the element that is removed. - CHECK
5° "get(index)" -> Returns the element at the specified position in the list. - CHECK
6° "getFirst()" -> Returns the first element without removing it. - CHECK
7° "getLast()" -> Returns the last element without removing it. - CHECK
8° "removeAt(index)" -> Removes and returns the element at the specified index. - CHECK
9° "remove(value)" -> Removes the first occurrence of the specified value from the list and returns true. - CHECK
10° "contains(x)" -> Checks whether the list contains the specified element. - CHECK
11° "size()" -> Returns the number of elements in the list. - CHECK
12° "isEmpty()" -> Returns true if the list contains no elements. - CHECK
13° "clear()" -> Removes all elements from the list. - CHECK

Learning goals:
After this implementation, I noticed significant progress in my learning.
Working with references and pointers, and ensuring the list remained properly connected after each insertion or removal,
gave me greater clarity in understanding the methods used in a linked list. It also helped me refine my programming logic and,
most importantly, deepen my knowledge of fundamental data structures

AI-assisted development:
The use of AI (ChatGPT) focused on explaining how the internal methods of a list work,
providing analogies to better understand references, especially in insertion and removal operations at both the beginning and
the end and refining logical processes.
