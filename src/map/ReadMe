**** SOME BASIC OPERATIONS ****

- For this directory, a copy of the map structure was implemented

OPERATIONS:
1° - "put(x, y)" -> Adds an element with the key and the value. if key already exist, change its value - CHECK
2° - "get(x)" -> Returns the value from the key - CHECK
3° - "remove(x)" -> Removes value and key - CHECK
4° - "containsKey(x)" -> Returns true if a key is present in the map - CHECK
5° - "containsValue(x)" -> Returns true if a value valor is present - CHECK
6° - "size()" -> Return the size of the map - CHECK
7° - "isEmpty()" - Returns true if the map is empty - CHECK
8° - "clear()" -> Clear the structure - CHECK

Learning goals:
During the development of this data structure, it was possible to practice programming logic and apply concepts learned previously.
Through this implementation, I was able to improve my logical thinking, develop a critical approach to decision-making
for search strategies within an array, and gain new insights.

AI-assisted development:
With the help of AI, I was able to understand how the main operations implemented in a map work,
as well as question whether certain decisions (such as internal ordering and element removal) were valid choices for the developed data structure.
