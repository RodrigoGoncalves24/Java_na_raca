**** SOME BASIC OPERATIONS ****

- For this directory, i will implement a copy of the stack structure

OPERATIONS:
1° - "push(x)" -> Adds an element on the top of the stack - CHECK
2° - "pop()" -> Remove and return the top element - CHECK
3° - "peek()" -> Return the top element without removing it - CHECK
4° - "isEmpty()" -> Return true if the stack is empty - CHECK
5° - "size()" -> Return the size of elements - CHECK

Learning goals:
After applying this data structure, it was possible to better understand the logic behind inserting and removing elements at the top of the list,
gain a clearer understanding of how a stack structure works, and practice programming logic.

AI-assisted development:
The use of AI was focused on explaining the methods to be implemented in the data structure,
as well as identifying better ways to handle and return possible errors during element insertion and removal when the structure is empty.
